# GENERATING-WORD-CLOUD-IN-PYTHON


#### A Word Cloud is a picture made up of words where the size of each word shows how frequently it appears in the dataset i.e the bigger the word appears in the cloud the more often that word is used. They help us to identify the most common and important words in a text. In this article, we will understand about word cloud and how to generate it using Python.

For Example: If we analyze customer reviews of a movie like "good", "bad" or "average" might be bigger if they are mentioned many times. These are useful because they:

* Quickly show the most common words in text data
* Help to understand what people are talking about in large text files
* Make text data look visually appealing
* Allow easy identification of important words

# Implementing Word Cloud in Python

We will be using IMDB dataset and this dataset contains 50,000 movie reviews in CSV format. We will focus on the review column which contains the text data of the movie reviews. Below is the step by step implementation:

## Step 1: Loading the Dataset

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('/content/IMDB-Dataset.csv')

print(df.head())
Output:

word1
Dataset
Step 2: Understanding the Dataset
Before cleaning the text let's understand the dataset. The dataset contains two columns:

review: Contains the movie review text
sentiment: It shows whether the review is positive or negative
We are only interested in the review column. Let's check the column names and some sample text.


print(df.columns)

print(df['review'][0])
Output:

Index(['review', 'sentiment'], dtype='object') One of the  ....your darker side.

The review column contains detailed text reviews of movies. Our goal is to extract the most frequent words from these reviews.

Step 3: Cleaning the Text Data
Before generating the word cloud, we need to clean the text data which involves:

1. Removing punctuation

2. Converting text to lowercase

3. Removing stopwords i.e common words like "the", "is", "and"

re.sub(): This removes punctuation and numbers
STOPWORDS: These are list of common stopwords

import re
from wordcloud import STOPWORDS

text = ' '.join(df['review'].astype(str).tolist())

text = re.sub(r'[^A-Za-z\s]', '', text)

text = text.lower()

stopwords = set(STOPWORDS)
text = ' '.join(word for word in text.split() if word not in stopwords)
Step 4: Generating the Word Cloud
Now our text is clean, let's generate the word cloud.

WordCloud(): Generates the word cloud

from wordcloud import WordCloud
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

wordcloud = WordCloud(width=800, height=400, background_color='white').generate(text)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='bilinear')
plt.axis('off')  
plt.title("IMDB Movie Reviews Word Cloud")
plt.show()
Output:

word2
Word Cloud
Step 5: Customizing the Word Cloud
We can customize the word cloud with different options like:

1. Maximum number of words

2. Color scheme

3. Shape of the cloud

max_words: Limits the number of words
colormap: Changes the color of the word cloud

wordcloud = WordCloud(width=800, height=400, background_color='white', max_words=100, colormap='coolwarm').generate(text)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='bilinear')
plt.axis('off')
plt.title("Customized IMDB Movie Reviews Word Cloud")
plt.show()
Output:


Real life applications of Word Cloud
Sentiment Analysis: Imagine we have hundreds of customer reviews. By creating two word clouds one for positive words like "great" and "friendly" and another for negative words like "late" and "broken" we can easily see what customers like or dislike.
Social Media Analysis: Observing what's trending on social media by collecting hashtags and keywords, word clouds can visually highlight what's being talked about the most.
Real-Time Data: In live customer chats or support systems it can instantly show common issues like "delivery delay" or "payment error" which helps teams to respond faster.
By combining word clouds with NLP techniques we can see patterns, understand customer needs and make smarter data-driven decisions.
